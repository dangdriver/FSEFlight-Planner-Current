with the requirment changes to passwords in FSE special characters are required but soem do not work with the FSE flight planner

passwords with # or ! seem to cause issues with logging in
@ is known to work in passwords

2019 changes

File updated May 15th 2019 to use the new user key format of fse
source cade obtained from Doug Brinklow (MBlazerGuy) exe file edited by dangdriver.
all seems to work with old or new keys (limited testing)
only file changed was the exe all others the same  excepted added  an edited by dangdriver to the about screen.
doubtful I could make any functional changes to the code but wanted to keep this active on FSE.

Make sure you link to google earth and that you have a user key on fse

FYI my google Earth in windows 10 is located
 C:\Program Files\Google\Google Earth Pro\client\googleearth.exe
others may be different

If you dont have a user key it should pop up the following instructions on getting one.

 You have not generated your  FSEconomy User Access Key.This key is required for any FSEconomy User to access the XML Data Feeds.
On the FSEconomy Web Site  menu,  Home, then click  Data Feeds , then click the  Reset button beside your User Name, then try running the  FSE Flight Planner  again.


any comment or questions you can usualy find me around discord or twitch or in fse name on all three is dangdriver
